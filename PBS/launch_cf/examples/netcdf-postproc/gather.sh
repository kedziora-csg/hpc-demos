# The parallel phase reduced each input file to a region; this joins those
# pieces into the finished products.  It is deliberately NOT part of the command
# file: it has to wait for every step, so it runs once, afterwards.  That
# split -- an embarrassingly parallel phase followed by a small gather -- is the
# usual shape of this kind of analysis.

# It gathers exactly the outputs of the inputs in ./data, and refuses to run if

# series.  Anything else in the output directory, such as an earlier run on a
