# NUMA Placement for Threaded Python

[`../netcdf-postproc`](../netcdf-postproc) found that pinning made no
difference to independent, single-threaded steps. This example tests the case
that README pointed to instead: **one process whose threads share memory**,
doing work fast enough that memory bandwidth limits its speed.

**Status: a single-node trial.** `numa_test.sh` measures whether placement
changes the speed of this kind of work on a Derecho node. If it shows a clear
gap, the next step is a `launch_cf` version with one step per NUMA domain, like
[`../thread-placement`](../thread-placement). The ideas behind it are in
[`ThreadedAppIdea.md`](ThreadedAppIdea.md).

## The computation

[`climatology.py`](climatology.py) holds one month of hourly ERA5 2 m
temperature in memory (744 × 721 × 1440 float32, 3.1 GB). It splits the grid
into latitude bands, one per thread, and each thread computes the time mean
and standard deviation of its band, over and over, for a fixed time.

- **The threads really run at once.** NumPy releases the GIL inside each call,
  and the script sets `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, `BLIS_NUM_THREADS` and similar
  variables to 1, so its 16 threads are the only threads.
- **The work is limited by memory bandwidth.** Each pass reads the array twice
  and does about one flop per value, and the array is 50 times the L3 cache of
  a NUMA domain.
- **Reading the file isn't timed.** The field is read once into `/dev/shm`, so
  neither GLADE nor the HDF5 lock in netCDF4 is part of the measurement.

Each run prints one line: its throughput, the NUMA domains its threads ran on,
the domains holding its memory, and `local`, the share of the threads' time
spent on the domain that holds their own band. `climatology.py` finds where the
pages are with the `move_pages` system call, and where the threads run with
`sched_getcpu`.

## The trial

A Derecho node has 8 NUMA domains of 16 cores (see
[`../thread-placement/lscpu.txt`](../thread-placement/lscpu.txt)), so
[`numa_test.sh`](numa_test.sh) runs 8 processes of 16 threads, one per domain,
as `launch_cf` would run 8 steps per node. They load first, then compute
together for 20 seconds, so they compete for memory bandwidth throughout.

| case           | placement                                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `8 free`       | none. The main thread reads the array, so all of it lands in one domain |
| `8 touch`      | none, but each thread copies its own band, so its pages start where it is |
| `8 bind`       | `numactl --cpunodebind=d --membind=d`: threads and memory in domain *d* |
| `8 bind+pin`   | as `bind`, with each thread pinned to its own core             |
| `8 interleave` | `numactl --cpunodebind=d --interleave=all`: memory spread over all 8 domains |
| `1 free`       | one process alone on the node, unpinned                        |
| `1 bind`       | one process alone, bound to domain 0                           |

The last two show why the comparison needs a full node. A process alone and
unpinned can spread its threads, and with `touch` its memory, over every
domain's memory channels, so on an idle node leaving it unpinned may well be
faster.

## Running it

On Derecho, from this directory:

```
qsub -I -A $PBS_ACCOUNT -q main -l select=1:ncpus=128 -l walltime=00:30:00
./numa_test.sh               # 3 repeats of 20 s; or ./numa_test.sh <repeats> <seconds>
```

or as a batch job, `qsub -A $PBS_ACCOUNT numa_test.sh`. The script activates
the `npl-2026a` conda environment if NumPy and netCDF4 aren't already
available. It reads `e5.oper.an.sfc.128_167_2t` for January 2020 from GDEX on
GLADE. Set `ERA5_MONTH=YYYYMM` for another month, `ERA5_FILE` for any NetCDF
file with a 3-D field, or `SYNTHETIC=744` for random data of the same shape.

Each run prints a summary line, and every process's own line goes to
`numa_test.<host>.<time>.log`. The header also reports whether the kernel's
automatic NUMA balancing is on. When it is, the kernel moves pages toward the
threads using them while the test runs, which can narrow the gap between the
unpinned and bound cases.

## Results

To come.
